# My Developer Portfolio

# FYI
> NOTE: I am currently designing and writing a new web portfolio on my own and anticipate it will be launched Nov 2020. In the meantime you can view a [portfolio](https://tiftaylor-portfolio.herokuapp.com/) with my content that was done as a lab project while at Code Fellows.
