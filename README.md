**About**: This will be my official website portfolio for front-end and full-stack projects designed and written either by me as an individual, internship work, a teammate on a team project in Code Fellows, or a class project I coded with the design directed by a specific program lab. 


# FYI | Updated 10/21/2020
- My latest full-stack single page app was released October 2020. A place for people to share their tasting notes on tea. You can see it here: [Tea Tasting Notes](https://reviewyourtea.com)

- New Portfolio Coming Soon: I am currently designing and writing a new web portfolio on my own and anticipate it will be launched Nov 2020. In the meantime you can view a [portfolio](https://tiftaylor-portfolio.herokuapp.com/) with my content that was done as a lab project while at Code Fellows.
